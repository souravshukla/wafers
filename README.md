WAFER FAULT DETECTION

The inputs of various sensors for different wafers have been provided. In electronics, a wafer (also called a slice or substrate) is a thin slice of semiconductor used for the fabrication of integrated circuits. The goal is to build a machine learning model which predicts whether a wafer needs to be replaced or not(i.e., whether it is working or not) based on the inputs from various sensors. 

In order to to run this program open this project in pycharm/visualcode IDE:

1> Setup the new conda environment with python==3.6.9
        conda create -n envname python==3.6.9
        
2> Activate the new environment
3> Install from requirements.txt 
        pip install -r requirements.txt
4> Run the main.py
